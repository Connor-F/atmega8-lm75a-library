# LM75A library for ATMega8 Microcontrollers
- Check `LM75A_temperature_reader.c` for example usage
- The `LM75A_serial_reader.py` file can be used to read the temperature sensors value via a UART / USART to USB adapater
- OS pin on the LM75A should be connected directly to ground (not used by library)
